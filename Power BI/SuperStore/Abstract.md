## Project Objective
This is one of the portfolio projects to demonstrate different features of the Power BI. The objective of the dashboard is to reflect the monthly sales and profit comparison as well as forecast sales and profit based on previous years' sales. Also, it allows stakeholders to identify Sales trends based on Country, Region as well as drill through into reports by Category and Segment.

## Data Source
The dataset was collected from the site Kaggle as an Excel file, containing Sales details from 2014 to 2017. 
<br>
The data has been analysed for Column distribution, data profiling, identifying and replacing missing values using Power Query. The data is further categorized and partitioned into different tables, like Customers, and Products, and also created a Date table for Time Intelligence Analysis. The relationships were created using Data Modelling.

## Deliverables
The main dashboard analyses the products based on Category, Segment, Sales Insights, and Forecasts.<br>

<br>
The Decomposition tree allows users to identify Sales based on Year and Month, as added functionality, for Sales based on Country, Region, City, Category and Sub-Category. This allows users to make informed decisions for improving sales and generating profit, by targeting customers of a particular Region/City as well as promotions or marketing if required to promote sales in a particular Category or Sub-Category.
